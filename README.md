# Irr-reviews

Irr-reviews doesn't work yet. Don't use it.  But when it works, it will fetch
reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and then use inter-rater reliability (irr,
specifically, Cohen's weighted kappa) to determine which professional movie
reviewers most share your tastes in movies.  Because, really, professional movie
reviewers are not normal movie fans, and we shouldn't expect most of them to share
our tastes. So find the ones that most agree with you, follow them, and ignore the rest. 

Irr-reviews uses the [cohens-kappaJS module](https://github.com/aaronnorby/cohens-kappa-JS).
